    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These French crêpes are soft, tender, and paper thin. They taste just like they came from a fancy French restaurant!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour, sugar, and salt into a bowl; set aside. Beat eggs and milk together in a large bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in flour mixture until smooth; stir in melted butter. </li>
        <li>Lightly grease a griddle or frying pan; heat over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 2 tablespoons for each crêpe. Immediately rotate the skillet to spread batter out in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Shake the pan or loosen with a spatula; turn or flip it over and cook until other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
